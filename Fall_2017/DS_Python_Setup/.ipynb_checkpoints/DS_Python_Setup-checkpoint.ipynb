    "\n",
    "Data Science is a rapidly growing field with many different tools and technologies. While there are many languages and environments you could use for Data Science projects (R, SAS, STATA, Java, C++ ...) Python is the language that is often seen as most readable. Also, it is coincidentally the one that DPU DS leadership is most versed in.\n",

    "**Therefore** for those that do not currently have a platform they can use for Data Science, we will help you create one in a few easy steps. It doesn't matter if you have a Mac or a Windows Computer, we will provide a process for both."
