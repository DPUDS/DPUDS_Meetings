# Welcome to DePauwâ€™s Data Science Group (DPU DS)

The following code is used for DPU DS meetings and tutorials. Here are some notes on the structure of our group.

## You Can Find Everything on Our [Website](https://dpudatascience.wixsite.com/dpuds) 

If you are ever in doubt, visit our website. This will give you an overview of what we do as well as provide access to all of our resources and projects. Most importantly, our **`Calendar`** page will give an overview of events happening in the following weeks.


## We Use [GitHub](https://github.com) for Source Control

As you might have already guessed, we track our progress and our changes with Git. This way, over 15 different developers can contribute to DPU DS, without a loss of quality or credit attribution. Learn more about how to use Git [here](https://github.com/DPUDS/DPUDS_Meetings/blob/master/Fall_2017/GitHub_Trello_Setup/GitHub_Trello_Setup.ipynb).


## We Communicate Over [Slack](https://slack.com/)

For everything. Confused about a meeting time or location? Post your question in our **`#questions`** channel. Finished a project that you want to commit to the master branch? Ask us to merge your pull request via our **`#deploys`** channel. Being a member of our Slack Team is crucial for getting the latest DPU DS news. If you did not receive a link to join but would like one, please email us at **dpudatascience@gmail.com**.

## We Use [Trello](https://trello.com) for Project Management

Trello is a task management tool often used by software developers. As we will be working in Scrum Teams within an [Agile Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), this allows everyone to see who is working on what and contribute more effectively to DPU DS activities. If you did not get an invite to our Trello team, and would like one, please email us at **dpudatascience@gmail.com**.
